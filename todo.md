            ElectionMessage id
            Alive id ->
            Victory ->  SetPrimary
        Implementation
            An election ir run
                Node sends a new Election message.
                If it receives a message with a higer id than it has it set it self as secoundary
                It it has the highest process ID it sends a victory message
                If no Answer after 1s it bacame the leader and seds Victory message
                If P receives an Election message from another process with a lower ID it sends an Answer message back and starts the election process at the beginning, by sending an Election message to higher-numbered processes.
                If P receives a Coordinator message, it treats the sender as the coordinator.
     - [x] Add Join command
     - [x] Wire from secoundary
     - [x] Primary disconnection
     - [x] not recovering the keys file
     - [x] Implement replication transaction (Log based)
     - [x] Implement recovery message 
     - [x] Implement self election 
     - [x] Create a database from secundary
     - [x] Op log file reading as database
     - [ ] Document how to backup the admin datatabase
     - [ ] Document how the all election process works
     - [ ] Document only snapshoted dbs are restored from disaster??? Should we change it?
     - [ ] Update library to use the cluster (Js)
     - [ ] Compare performance with old version (argo + https://k6.io/open-source)
     - [ ] What if oplog file became too big? We need a command to clean oplog file
     - [ ] Some times election falling in ./tests/test-fail-primary-dbs.sh all
     - [ ] Implement ping command
- [ ] Read https://jepsen.io/analyses/redis-raft-1b3fbf6
- [x] Add cli interface
- [x] Remove the need to admin auth to use an database  
- [x] Send and errro if the DB does not exits
- [x] Add un-watch command 
- [x] add secret token to create datbase 
- [ ] Read https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/faster-sigmod18.pdf
- [x] Reduce the size of the docker image

# Main goal 

* Delivery content change in the front ent at the time it changes (fast)

# What may change over time

* Query language (I am not sure if NQL will go or I will use some kind of GraphQA)
* Hash map to Tree or key lock Hash map
* Security layer
* Client protocols
